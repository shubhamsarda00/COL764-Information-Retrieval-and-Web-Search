**Question Answering and Conversation in Information Retrieval**

In this paper, we study the question answering domain in information retrieval, especially in a conversational manner. We analyse some state-of-the-art models in 
the domain of question answering and conversational question answering, and the technologies used and proposed in them. We examine and compare these models, and discuss
some of the limitations in the currently existing models. Further, we discuss the scope for future work in this area, and suggest a preliminary ensemble model that can
address the primary issues that come with this information retrieval strategy.

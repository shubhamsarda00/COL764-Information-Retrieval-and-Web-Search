# Assignment 1

In this assignment, we implement a **Vector Space Retrieval** model to create an efficient retrieval system that can different type queries such as prefix search queries, name entity tagged queries etc. More detailed problem statement can be found in **assignment1.pdf**. More details on the model implemented and query handling can be found in **Algorithmic Details of the Vector Space Retrieval Model.pdf**. 

## Details for Running the Code

**Libraries Required:**
1. numpy
2. nltk
3. pickle
4. bzip
5. os
6. sys
7. random

Python version >= 3.7.4
Stanford ner tagger has been used for tagging. It must be present in the src folder for running the code.

It can be downloaded from--
https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-ner-4.0.0.zip

The tagger also requires the java path. If its not already added to PATH, you can either give it as the last cmd line argument to vecsearch.py, It'll be extracted using sys.argv[12]
command-line arguments:
--query queryfile: a file containing keyword queries, with each line corresponding
to a query
--cutoff k: the number k (default 10) which specifies how many top-scoring
results have to be returned for each query
--output resultfile: the output file named resultfile which is generated by your
program, which contains the document ids of all documents that
have top-k (k as specified) highest-scores and their scores in each
line (note that the output could contain more than k documents).
Results for each query have to be separated by 2 newlines.
--index indexfile: the index file generated by invidx cons program above
--dict dictfile: the dictionary file generated by the invidx cons program above
--java path: path to java.exe in the bin folder inside jdk folder

the java.exe path is of the format-
java_path = "C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-11.0.3/bin/java.exe"

Kindly provide it as the cmd line argument or you can even change it manually.
Its in the first 5 lines of the vecsearch script in the form

import os,sys
java_path=""
try:
    java_path = sys.argv[12]
except:
    java_path = "C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-11.0.3/bin/java.exe"
        
os.environ['JAVAHOME'] = java_path

My highest ndcg was 0.2467 and highest F1@100 was .158

My compressed size of index files was 64.47 mb
